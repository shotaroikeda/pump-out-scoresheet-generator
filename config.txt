# This configuration file specifies which charts to include in the spreadsheet.
# Follow the instructions for each section and save your changes when done.
#


[Mixes]

# If a mix listed below is uncommented, all charts that appeared in that mix
# will appear in the score sheet, including charts that were introduced in
# previous mixes.
#
# If you do NOT want to include a mix, comment it out by prefixing it with the
# hash character (#).
#
# In most cases you will probably only want to have one mix uncommented unless
# you regularly play more than one mix.
#
# Do NOT change the spelling or punctuation of the mixes, as they must exactly
# match the mix titles in the Pump Out database (column `mix.internalTitle`).

# Similar to above, if you do NOT want the score sheet to include charts from a
# particular mode, then comment it out by prefixing it with the hash character.
#
# Otherwise leave them uncommented.
#
# Do NOT change the spelling or punctuation of the modes, as they must exactly
# match the mode titles in the Pump Out database (column `mode.internalTitle`).
