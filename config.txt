# The following section specifies which charts to include in the spreadsheet.
#
# If a mix listed below is uncommented, all charts that appeared in that mix
# will appear in the score sheet, including songs that were carried forward
# from previous mixes.  For example, if you leave XX uncommented the score
# sheet will contain entries for each chart of the song Dignity, since those
# charts were playable in XX.
#
# If you do NOT want to include a mix, comment it out by prefixing it with the
# hash character (#).  Remember to save the file when you are done.
#
# In most cases you will probably only want to have one mix uncommented unless
# you regularly play more than one mix.
#
# Do NOT change the spelling or punctuation of the mixes, as they must exactly
# match the mix titles in the Pump Out database (column `mix.internalTitle`).
